# Flows, Territory, and Identity: A Study of the Strait of Messina

This project investigates the dynamic interplay of individual flows, territorial transformation, and identity in the context of the **Strait of Messina**, Italy. 
Drawing from **art, cartography**, and **time-geography**, it explores how infrastructural changes—such as the proposed Messina Bridge—could reshape perceptions of mobility, 
regional accessibility, and cultural identity.

### 🧠 Abstract

This multidisciplinary project examines how **ephemeral flows**—such as travel and migration—transform both the physical and conceptual geographies of the **Strait of Messina**. 
Combining **artistic expression** and **spatial modeling**, it investigates how proposed infrastructure like the **Messina Bridge** could impact regional movement and identity.

Key components include:

- A **NetLogo simulation**, *Flight-Train-Connect*, which models the spatial and temporal effects of the bridge on transportation flows.
- An experimental **“growing tree” model** to visualize increased connectivity between Messina and Naples.


This project bridges theory and practice, offering a unique lens on how global infrastructure affects local lives.

## 🔧 Technical Components

- **NetLogo Simulation:**  
  Developed to visualize and analyze train and flight accessibility changes based on various bridge construction scenarios.

- **Growing Tree Model:**  
  Visual metaphor and algorithm for evolving transport connectivity based on time-space prisms (inspired by Hägerstrand, 1970).
